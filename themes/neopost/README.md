# neopost
*neopost* is a minimalist, customizable theme for personal blogs, inspired by the aesthetics of neocities. it allows for flexible content management and easy customization of styles through simple configuration.
![neopost example site, with the "light-blue" variant theme.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salatine/neopost/main/images/screenshot.png)
this example site is available at [neopost.neocities.org](https://neopost.neocities.org).

## installation
```bash
hugo new site my-site
cd my-site
git clone "https://github.com/salatine/neopost.git" themes/neopost
```


## configuration
edit `hugo.yaml` to configure the theme:
```yaml
baseURL: "https://example.com"
theme: "neopost"
params:
    theme: "light-purple"
```
set the desired color by changing the `theme` parameter inside `params`, currently there are `light-blue`, `dark-blue`, `light-green`, `light-yellow`, `light-pink`, `light-purple` as options.


## example site
it's *HIGHLY!* recommended to test the example provided with the theme, just to learn how to mess with it. you can do that by running (considering you already did the installation steps):
```bash
cp -r themes/neopost/example/. .
hugo serve
```

## creating content

### posts
```
hugo new content/posts/new_post.md
```
this is most of your stuff, a post will appear at the main page and each one will have a page for itself. you can also attribute tags to your posts, which then can be filtered to easily find specific posts.
you can edit it at `content/posts/new_post.md`.


### sidebar
```
hugo new --kind sidebar sidebar
```
the sidebar from the main page, add a bio and little information about you!
you can edit it at the directory `content/sidebar/`, there are multiple markdown files to edit


### welcome header
```
hugo new --kind welcome_header welcome_header
```
this is above all the posts in the main page, you can give yourself a better introduction here, and say whatever you want.
you can edit it at `content/welcome_header/_index.md`.
